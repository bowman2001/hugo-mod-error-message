title: Hugo module for error messages

Nothing to see here.

Warning and error messages appear in the console. Error messages let the build fail, get logged, and appear in the browser too.

Here, the partial "md-error-msg" is **not** called from a template processing Markdown (render hook) as it is supposed to.
